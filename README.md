# Machester Boxing
Manchester Boxing is a websiter developed for an imaginary community boxing club whose mission is to promote health and fitness by providing boxing training. The club is seeing an increased demand and therefore created a website so anyone interested can join and attend the group classes. It is a fun way to get healthy.
